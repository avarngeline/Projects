# Power BI Workflow: Candy Distribution Analytics Report

## 1. Overview
**Problem Statement**

The candy distributor in the United States faces challenges in optimising its supply chain efficiency, maximising profitability, and improving customer satisfaction. Key areas of concern include identifying the most profitable regions, understanding product profitability, evaluating factory production efficiency, and analysing shipping logistics.

To address these challenges, this analysis focuses on:

- Sales Performance: Identifying the most profitable regions and understanding sales distribution across product divisions.
- Product Profitability: Analysing profit margins and the relationship between production costs and sales prices across different product categories.
- Factory Production Performance: Assessing factory production efficiency and cost management to enhance operational effectiveness.
- Shipping Analysis: Examining shipping mode preferences and their impact on customer satisfaction across different states.

The objective is to uncover actionable insights that can drive better decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall business performance.


## 2. Data Model

**2.1. Relationship and Data Schema**

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa3a0cf-c60b-4ad7-a090-6eeab4b9936e)

The model follows a **star schema** design, where a central fact table connects to multiple dimension tables. This structure optimises query performance and simplifies business analysis.

**Fact Table**
- **Candy_Sales**: Contains transactional data such as sales, costs, and gross profit.

## 3. Data Transformation (Power Query)

**3.1. Applied Steps**  

Three key transformation steps are taken in Power Query, as shown below.

  **1) Data Preview**  
  
After the data is loaded into Power Query, column quality, column distribution, and column profiling are selected to showcase the data structure.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c537170-dcbc-46d1-8473-c4afd4a1aa3f)

This step helps identify value distributions, empty or null entries, and any inconsistencies or errors. A thorough review ensures that the data is clean and ready for further analysis and reporting.

*Table: Candy_Sales*
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc7bd04b-3e48-4e25-ac3e-2358c9d37460) 

*Table: Candy_Products*
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c46a6752-3fe5-4269-a608-38a59a3bed3e)

*Table: Candy_Factories*
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7fc9a48-c0b7-4c2b-ae4b-4dbf88418251)

  **2) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  

*1. Remove Unnecessary Columns*
- Keeping only relevant fields can improve performance.  
- For the Candy_Sales table, columns such as Ship_Date, order_id, customer_id, postal_code, and Product_id were removed as they were not needed for the analysis.

*2. Change Data Types* 
- To convert columns to the correct data types (e.g., Text, Date, Numeric). 
- For the Candy_Sales table, the gross_profit and cost columns were changed to Decimal data type, and the unit column was changed to Whole Number.

*3. Trim & Clean Text* 
- To remove extra spaces, incorrect characters, and formatting issues.  
- For the Candy_Sales and Candy_Products tables, the product_name column was shortened (e.g., from "Wonka Bar - Scrumdiddlyumptious" to "Scrumdiddlyumptious"), and the ship_mode column was renamed to be more meaningful (e.g., from "First Class" to "Next Day").

*4. Transform data*
- To structure the dataset
- For the Candy_Factories table, the "Use First Row as Headers" option was applied to identify the header columns.

*5. Create Custom Columns* 
- To add calculated fields using M language or built-in functions.
- For the Candy_Factories table, the "Use First Row as Headers" option was applied to identify the header columns.

*6. Split Columns* 
- Separating combined text fields (e.g., splitting full names into first & last names).  
- For the Candy_Sales table, the order_date column was split using a delimiter to separate the time from the date, and the time column was removed as it was not used in the analysis, helping reduce space usage.


**3) Loading Data to Power BI**
- Close & Apply â†’ Load transformed data into Power BI for further modeling & visualisation.

**Results**

## 4. DAX Calculations & Measures (Power BI Desktop)

**4.1. Key Measures**  

Three key measures are created for the analysis, mainly to used in the sales performance analysis.

| Measure Name | DAX Formula | Description | 
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Cost-to-Sales_ratio     | DIVIDE(SUM(Candy_Sales[cost]), SUM(Candy_Sales[sales]))  | The proportion of total costs relative to total sales      |
| YoY_sales     | CALCULATE(SUM(Candy_Sales[sales]),   SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))| The Year-over-Year sales, showing total sales for the same period last year|
| YoY_sales_growth %     | DIVIDE(SUM(Candy_Sales[sales]) - [YoY_sales],[YoY_sales], 0)| The percentage growth in sales compared to the same period last year|

**4.2. Calculated Table**

| Table Name | DAX Formula | Description | 
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| DateTable     | CALENDAR(MIN(Candy_Sales[order_date]), MAX(Candy_Sales[order_date]))  | Date table to support time intelligence     |



## 5. Report Visualisation & Design

**5.1. Page Layout and Key Areas of Analysis**
- Sales Performance: Evaluating overall sales trends to see seasonality and timing, order volumes, and gross profit distribution across different product dicision and regions.
- Product Profitability: Identifying the trend of profit margin and the most profitable product division and assessing cost structures to optimise margins.
- Factory Production Performance: Analysing factory output, comparing cost to sales ratio and identifying the best performer in the view of cost optimisation.
- Shipping Analysis: Determining the most and least efficient factory-to-customer shipping routes to reduce costs and enhance logistics.

**5.2. Key Visuals & Interactions**  

The following visualisations were created in Power BI to represent the data effectively 

**1) Sales Performance Page**  
- **Card: YoY Sales Growth, Total Sales, Total Units**

This chart helps understand the overall business expansion by showing the percentage growth in sales compared to the previous year, total revenue generated, and the total number of units sold.
